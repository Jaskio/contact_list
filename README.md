# Phonebook

As name suggests, this is a simple phonebook listing with previously stored contacts and additional feature to merge contacts with same first and last name. It was part of my AngularJS learning process.


## Setup

* Go to rootProject/public and type
```
npm install
```

* In root directory install json-server and set watch event
```
npm install -g json-server
json-server --watch storage/db.json
```
